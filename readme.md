# betterU

a group project where we made a fitness app with vibrant colors and various features

features:
- users are able to track their weight progress through line graphs and level up as they complete more workouts in the app
- users can share their thoughts and interact with other posts through liking and replying
- dark mode is available, and the app keeps of track of which theme each user is currently using
- data is stored using a Provider
